- cell 8: Histogram of # of supporting reads from each tool 
- cell 9: Histogram of # of clone size from each tool
- cell 11: clone size relative error (|clone size from RNA-Seq tool - clone size from TCR-Seq|/clone size from TCR-Seq)
- cell 12: Scatter plot of clone size (TCR vs IMREP, TCR vs MIXCR, TCR vs TRUST4)
- cell 13 : SDI relative error (|RNA-Seq tool SDI - TCR-Seq SDI|/TCR-seq SDI)
